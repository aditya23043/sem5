= The three pass approach =

* Read the paper in up to three passes instead of starting at the beginning and plowing your way to the end
* Eadh pasta accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pasta
* 1st pass: general idea about the paper
* 2nd pass: lets you grasp the paper's content but not the details
* 3rd pass: understand the paper in depth
