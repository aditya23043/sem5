# Technical Communication Course Summary

## Session 1: Introduction to Effective Technical Writing

**Core Principles:**
- Good writing communicates ideas clearly with logical progression
- Requires clarity, precision, accuracy, and multiple revisions
- Scientific writing should be simple, focused, and avoid unnecessary jargon

**Key Guidelines:**
- Keep sentences under 20-25 words
- One idea per paragraph
- Avoid hedge words (might, could, would suggest)
- Avoid hidden negation and weak intensifiers (very, interestingly, novel)
- Prefer active voice over passive (though passive has specific uses)
- Use present simple (70%), past simple (23%), and present perfect (5%) tenses appropriately

**What to Avoid:**
- Redundancies, excessive modifiers, long/sophisticated words unnecessarily
- Starting with lengthy generalizations
- Gender-biased language

## Session 2: From Clutter to Clarity

**Characteristics of Good Scientific Writing:**
- Clear, simple, impartial, structured logically, accurate, objective
- Uses technical terms only when necessary
- Employs objective rather than subjective language

**Voice Choices:**
- **Passive voice:** useful for formal/depersonalized writing, when agent is obvious/unimportant
- **Active voice:** clearer, more direct, easier to read
- Balance personal and impersonal expressions for clarity

**Sentence Structure:**
- Avoid starting with long modifying clauses
- Cut unnecessary words (e.g., "along the lines of" → "like")
- Divide complex sentences into separate phrases
- Rephrase for brevity without losing meaning

## Session 3: How to Read a Scientific Paper

**Three-Pass Approach:**

**First Pass (5-10 minutes):**
- Read title, abstract, introduction
- Read section headings only
- Read conclusions
- Glance at references
- Answer the 5 Cs: Category, Context, Correctness, Contributions, Clarity

**Second Pass (up to 1 hour):**
- Read with greater care, ignore proofs
- Jot down key points, annotate
- Examine figures/diagrams carefully
- Mark relevant unread references

**Third Pass (4-5 hours for beginners, 1 hour for experienced):**
- Virtually re-implement the paper
- Identify and challenge every assumption
- Reconstruct entire structure from memory
- Identify strong/weak points, implicit assumptions, missing citations

**Literature Survey Strategy:**
1. Find 3-5 recent papers using keywords
2. Find shared citations and repeated authors
3. Check top conferences' recent proceedings

## Session 4: Academic Summary

**Definition:**
- Concise representation of academic text showing argumentation structure
- Different from abstract (which shows aim, method, results, conclusions)

**Requirements:**
- Accuracy, completeness, emphasis, readability, own words
- Must include: research question, method, results/arguments, motivation/relevance, theoretical framework, conclusions
- Write in flowing text without direct quotes
- Don't include personal opinions

**Three Functions:**
1. Explaining a text
2. Replacing a text
3. Discussing a text

**Format Tips:**
- First sentence: identify author, title, thesis
- Use paragraph form with clear transitions
- Avoid repetition, minor details, digressions

---

## Session 5: Ethics in Research and Publication

**Authorship Criteria (all 4 must be met):**
1. Substantial contribution to conception/design/analysis
2. Drafting or revising for intellectual content
3. Approval of final version
4. Agreement to be accountable

**Unacceptable Types:**
- Ghost authors (contribute but not acknowledged)
- Guest authors (no contributions, added for prestige)
- Gift authors (negligible affiliation)

**Forms of Misconduct:**

**Plagiarism Types:**
- Literal copying (word-for-word without quotes/citation)
- Substantial copying (research materials, processes)
- Paraphrasing (reproducing ideas without acknowledgment)
- Text-recycling (reusing own work without citation)

**Publication Issues:**
- Simultaneous submission (submitting to multiple journals)
- Duplicate publication (resubmitting published work)
- Salami slicing (breaking one study into multiple papers)

**Research Fraud:**
- Fabrication (making up data)
- Falsification (manipulating data/images)

---

## Session 6: Paraphrasing, Summarizing, and Quoting

**Paraphrasing:**
- Express ideas in own words with similar length
- NOT just replacing words with synonyms
- Requires substantial rephrasing while retaining meaning
- Always cite the source

**4-Step Process:**
1. Read and fully understand source
2. Take notes, list key terms
3. Write without looking at source
4. Check accuracy and add citation

**Quoting:**
- Use exact author's words with quotation marks
- Use sparingly in science/technology
- Requires page numbers in citation
- Justified when: new theory/concept, definition, unusual impact, notable authority

**Citation Types:**
- **Information-prominent:** citation follows content
- **Author-prominent:** author mentioned in sentence subject

**Summarizing:**
- Brief outline of main points in own words
- Focus on overall message and key points
- Leave out details and examples

---

## Session 7: Scientific Literature Review

**Purpose:**
- Communicate advancement of scientific knowledge
- Save time for scientific community
- Lead to new insights, highlight gaps/controversies

**Requirements:**
- Clear statement of scope
- Range of research (including conflicting data)
- Critical analysis with backed-up arguments
- Indication of further research needed
- Identification of controversies

**Four Stages:**
1. **Problem formulation:** Define topic, scope, aspects
2. **Literature search:** Identify relevant research (Google Scholar, Web of Science)
3. **Critical analysis:** Question assumptions, identify conflicts, assess evidence
4. **Evaluation:** Judge most convincing authors, check objectivity

**Critical Thinking Aspects:**
- Identify evidence for/against key points
- Detect inconsistencies, bias, premature conclusions
- Distinguish fact from opinion
- Evaluate conflicting research
- Construct own arguments

**Structure:**
- **Introduction:** Overview, objectives, importance
- **Main body:** Critical analysis with subheadings, 2-3 key points per section
- **Conclusion:** Summarize contributions, point out gaps, suggest future studies

## Session 8: Scientific Paper and IMRAD Format

**IMRAD Structure:**

**Introduction:**
- States hypothesis and its derivation
- Connects to previous research
- Gives experiment purpose

**Methods:**
- Details how hypothesis was tested
- Provides enough detail for replication
- Explains new methodology thoroughly

**Results:**
- Provides raw, uninterpreted data
- Uses tables, figures, percentages/ratios
- Follows logical sequence

**Analysis:**
- Inspects, cleanses, transforms data
- Discovers useful information
- Supports decision-making

**Discussion:**
- Considers if data support hypothesis
- Explores implications
- Judges limitations of experimental design

**Additional Sections:**
- Title page, Abstract, Contents, Conclusions, References, Bibliography, Acknowledgements, Appendices

**Technical Report Guidelines:**
- Single-sided, white A4 paper
- Proper page numbering
- Standard 12pt font (Times New Roman)
- Include diagrams, graphs, tables with proper labels
- Always reference sources to avoid plagiarism

## Session 9: Research Pitch and Abstract

**Research Pitch (3-2-1 Method):**

**THREE building blocks (IDioTs guide):**
- **Idea:** Core idea, central hypothesis
- **Data:** What data, sources, unit of analysis, obstacles
- **Tools:** Research design, methods, compatibility

**TWO key questions:**
- **What's new?** Novelty in idea/data/tools
- **So what?** Why is answer important, impact

**ONE bottom line:**

**Abstract:**

**Purpose:**
- Brief overview of research
- Includes aim, objectives, methodologies, outcomes
- 150-200 words typically

**4-Step Structure:**
1. **Introduction (1-2 sentences):** Topic, purpose, research questions
2. **Methods (1-2 sentences):** Research methods, data analysis
3. **Results (1-2 sentences):** Findings/discoveries
4. **Discussion (1-2 sentences):** Conclusions, recommendations, impact

**Tips:**
- Follow submission guidelines
- Use formal language
- Make title informative
- Don't include references unless required
