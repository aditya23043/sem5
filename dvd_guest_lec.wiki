* DFM: Design for manufacturability
* Getting 22nm resolution wih 193nm light source
* Double patterning
* Expose the design twice with different masks to achieve much higher resolution
* Theoretically, we can use more than 2 masks for one design to get even higher resolution

= LELE Double Patterning =
* Space between the pink and green lines is less than the technology's resolution
* Layout → Decomposed Layout
* Practically, it is difficult to decompose optimally
* Cost of lithography roughly doubles
* Contributed to non-recurring cost (needed even if one chip has to be manufactured)
* Alignment is difficult to get spot-on and even small misalignment can lead to major issues
* STICHING: use stiches for areas which couldn't be easily decomposed
* Litho-etch-Litcho-etch : LELE
	* Double lithography and double etch
	* works or 1D design
	* very hard for 2D
* 2-color problem is easy
* 3-coloring problem is NP hard
* DP posed as a threat to moore's law as the cost per transistor started to go up or at least stay constant as we scale due to increased cost of chip

= Self Aligned Double Patterning (SADP) =
* Also called spacer lithography
* In theory, we could expand this technique indefinitely
* While designing, we need to think a lot about trims and spacers (not practical)
* Decompose into mandrel and non-mandrel shapes

Need massive jump
Double or quadruple patterning seemed too hard
Switched from 193nm to 11-13nm with Extreme Ultraviolet Light
Difficult to find materials which are transparent to EUV
So, switched from lens to mirrors
EUV photon is very high energy
Whenever it hits the reflective mask, they get damaged slightly each time
So many mirrors are used in between that the light looses its energy
Monopoly held by ASML in netherland
The tool is heavier than a Boeing-747
ASML's system uses a high-energy laser to hit tiny droplets of molten tin to create a plasma that emits EUV light.
Challenge with EUV: pellicle
Already short of light. We can't add another cover which reduces the light intensity further
Defect Avoidance in EUV masks
EUV is used in 7nm and below technologies
With current generation EUV, 26nm pitch

Resolution = K * λ / NA
NA: Numerical Aperture

EBDW: Electron-beam direct write
Very slow
Went from wafers/hour to hours/wafer
No requirement of a mask
Directly writing to a die
Lower cost
Great for low volume chips

Nano-imprint Litho
Create a mold and press it against the wafer
Problem: we need to ensure mold remains defect-free after multiple "pressing"
We are not time constrained for making this mold and hence we can use direct writing to make this mold

Directed Self Assembly (DSA)
Controlling defects is very hard

Design Rules

Scalable / Lambda DRs
Using stick diagrams to showcase DRs because we can just multiply the "sticks" by a const to go to actual layout

Two separate DR values : Strongly recommended (rec) and minimum (min)
rec considers good enough margin to reduce yield loss
min for market literature / PR

but almost all designers use min because it "looks" like faster and smaller, atleast in their simulations

Overhang DRC for poly because:
1. Poly shapes are patterning critical. prone to round, line-end pullback and  similar optical defects
2. Overlay margin: If due to some issue, there is a slight size difference, then the poly won't cover the diffusion properly and transistor won't function properly

RDR (Restrictive / Prescriptive Design Rules)
* Rules about what not to do

Pattern-based DRs = DRC+
