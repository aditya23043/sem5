= Important Terms =
* Maximum Diameter = 232 bit time
	* Max distance between two nodes
* Jam Signal = 32 - 48 bits
	* The moment any transmitting node experiences collision, it starts a jam signal which is a sequence of 10 10 10.... till 48 bits
* Interframe Delay = 96 bit time
	* Delay before a node waits before transmitting (while the channel is idle)
	* Even the first transmission does not happan at t=0; it happens at t=96 bit time
	* If it receives any signal before this timeout happens, the node backs off
* Note:
	* Round trip bits = 2 * 232 bit = 464 bit
	* Ethernet frame size = 512 bits
	* Subtract → 512 - 464 = 48 bits (jam signal)
* Jam signal goes in the end (in place of the CRC) and ensures that CRC check fails

```example
Eth frame size = 512
preamble = 8 bytes = 64 bits
total -> 576 bits

If B starts sending at t=324, it will reach A at t=649 but A had already sent all the frame bits (576) and since not collision was detected in between, it won't retransmit
Hence we need to cap our propagation delay at 232 bits times
we can also increase the interframe delay to more than the propagation delay but that will impact idle delay by a LOT
```

prop delay = 245 bit times

= Ethernet Switches =
* Earlier we used to use Hubs which used to just amplify the signal and transfer on all busses and for collisions we used CSMA/CD
* Now, we use switches in which no 2 nodes are sending on the same signal
* CSMA/CD not required but some people are still using hubs so CSMA/CD is still kept
* If nobody is sending, it gives full bandwidth (great)
* MUX logic used in ethernet switches
* Ethernet switches are plug-and-play, self-learning (not much overhead)
	* Switches need not be configured
* Switches also have mapping tables (switch table) like routers but much simpler because eth frames contains the dest and src mac address
* Initially, it needs to do some broadcast for mapping ports to mac address
* a.k.a layer 2 switches
* routers are also called layer 3 switches
* We can have cascaded switches and it will still learn very fast

> Link layer (lvl 6) done

= Synthesis =
* DHCP → UDP
* DNS → UDP
* ARP
* TCP
* HTTP

> VLAN will not be done

= Wireless Networks =
* TCP performs worse in the case of wireless technology due to the channel being even more unreliable can result in more congestion and that slows the transmission rate
* Requires a "base station"
* Those base stations are themselves connected by wire
* Note: they can be connected wirelessly but it would introduce some problems, so generally → wired
* Two types of wireless networks
	1. Infrastructure : centralized controller
	2. Ad-hoc : like p2p; theoretically good but practically complex
		* No base stations
		* Used for sensor deployment
		* nodes can only transmit to other nodes within link coverage
		* Eg: Zigbee, Bluetooth

== Problems ==
* Multipath propagation in wireless link
	* Receiver not just receives radio signals from Access point directly; but also signals bouncing off of the walls and other objects, etc
* Hidden Terminal problem
* Attenuation

= CSMA/CA =
* Very difficult to detect collisions in wireless link
* So, we should avoid collisions
* Needs coordination
* Take permission from all nodes to transmit
* RTS message = Request-To-Send
* CTS message = Clear-To-Send
* send RTS. wait for CTS. if CTS comes, wait for some time and then start transmission
* much less efficient than wired but still a solution
* need to implement fairness
* Complexity: there could be many hidden terminals

= CDMA =
* Code division multiple access
* each node gets a unique code
* encode the original message with the code
* Receiver decodes messages with key = node's code
* better than FDMA, TDMA
