= CCN =

* currently we search for some content by searching the host which has that data
	* we go to the machine and then that finds and returns the data
	* pros: if you know the address, it is easy to find it there every time
	* cons: if a lot of people want that data → congestion
	* challening when the content is important
	* we want "content" but we are forced to go a device to find the content
* Soln: Content-Centric networking / Information Centric Network / Named Data Networking
	* All are same thing just with different names
	* Basically caching at routers
	* earlier, we had caching only at the local level
	* Start naming the content
	* dont care about machine
	* number of node visited is reduced -> faster
	* more popular -> even one machine fails, we still have other machines
* Challenges
	* Addressing
		* How to access the "content" if we dont have 
	* Content ownership
	* Updating content
	* Authenticity of content
		* Earlier, you were sure that that "machine" was trustable either by certificate or just trust
	* DNS lookup challenges
		* Number of Table entries increased significantly
		* DNS size is still not much but the we are caching the whole content so we need to have optimised storage solution
		* Need alternate DNS (traditional dns wont work)
* Now we need to implement security at the content level, not the machine level
* tries to combine ideas of P2P and CDN
* Unicast: one to one
* Multicast: one to many (spanning trees used, complex to implement)
* Broadcast: one to ALL (considered waste of resources, but simple to implement)
* Need optimisations at router storage like TTL or priority
> ICN conference
* Routers do pro-active caching even if that data is not requested yet but have a high change of being requested in the near future
* Prevents dDoS
* Side channel attack: fetch data through attack through which the targeted data is inferred
	* Like population detected from overall power consumption in a local network
* SNMP based attendance system
