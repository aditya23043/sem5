# CMOS End sem topics
* Current Mirror (source / sink)
* Inverting Amplifier
* Frequency Response
* Differential Amplifiers
* Voltage Reference
* Power amplifer
* Op Amp Design
* Op Amp Advanced
* Switching Capacitor Circuits (not in syllabus)

## Voltage Reference
* Offset voltage in differential amplifier
* Temperature independent votage source
* PTAT, CTAT
* Start-up circuit

## Op Amp Design
* Design steps
	1. Specifications
	2. Design
	3. Analysis, Simulation
	4. Modify
* Quality Factor
* Compensator circuits
	1. Miller
	2. Self-compensating
	3. Feedforward
* Overshoot
	* Noise
	* higher power consumption
* PSRR != Power supply sensitivity
* P_diss gives the maximum current that we can flow through the circuit (because supply is constant)
* I6 > I5

## Advanced CMOS Op-Amp

* Noise Analyis
	* Spectral Density
	* 1st stage noise is always prominent
* Noise Sources
	* Shot: discrete noise
		* Negligible
		* Constant, so new_avg != old_avg
	* Thermal: random thermal motion of electrons
	* Flicker: (1/F) where F=frequency
