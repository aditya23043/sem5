# Stuff to be submitted

* Min voltage across the current source (Vmin)
* output resistance of the circuit (Ro)

# Stuff to do

* We need to do the schematic on virtuoso (65nm technology)
* Layout not required
* we need to do ADE L simulation 


* Vds = Vout
* Rout = across D and S

* In the current mirror ckt, tweak the width in order to change Id
* for min Vout, Vgs1 = Vgs2
* minimize λ (channel width modulation)
* λ depends on Vds

common source, common gate, common drain, cascode
single stage amplifier: razavi
small signal analysis

Ro increases -> Area increases

# three topologies

1. current source
2. resistance
3. diode connected MOSFET
	* used to get very high resistance
