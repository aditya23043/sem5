= lecture 1 =
* Manages hardware (CPU, memory, IO)

== How to run a program ==
* A compiler translates high level programs into an executable (.c -> a.out)

* fetch instruction pointed at by PC from mem
* loads data required by instruction into registers
* decodes and executes instruction
* stores results to memory

== OS manages ==
* CPU
* Memory
* Interface with IO devices
* Concurrency
* Virtualization

== STUFF == 
* getpid() -> returns process id
* assert
* Spin(int second) -> sleep for [second]

* Dummy Address (Memory Virtualization)
	* Real address behind it might be different
	* Isolated to the current process
